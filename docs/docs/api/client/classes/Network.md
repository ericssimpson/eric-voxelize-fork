A network connector to the Voxelize backend. Establishes a WebSocket connection to the backend
server and handles the Protocol Buffer encoding and decoding.

# Example
```ts
const network = new VOXELIZE.Network();

network
 .connect("ws://localhost:5000")
 .then(() => {
   network.join("my-world").then(() => {
     console.log("Joined world!");
   });
});
```

## Methods

### action

▸ **action**(`type`, `data?`): `void`

Send an `ACTION` type message to the server. For more information about the protocol
buffer message system, see [here](/tutorials/basics/protocol-networking).

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `type` | `string` | The type of action to perform. |
| `data?` | `any` | The specific data attached to this action. |

#### Returns

`void`

___

### connect

▸ **connect**(`serverURL`, `params?`): `Promise`<[`Network`](Network.md)\>

Connect to a Voxelize server. Remember to set username and ID before connection if
you want to specify them manually. Otherwise ID is generated by the server, and username
would be "Guest XXXXX" where `XXXXX` is a random 5-digit number.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `serverURL` | `string` | The URL to the Voxelize server. |
| `params` | [`NetworkParams`](../modules.md#networkparams-2) | Parameters to customize the connection to a Voxelize server. |

#### Returns

`Promise`<[`Network`](Network.md)\>

A promise that resolves when the client has connected to the server.

___

### disconnect

▸ **disconnect**(): `void`

Disconnect the client from the server.

#### Returns

`void`

___

### flush

▸ **flush**(): `void`

Gathers all the network packets from the network intercepts and sends them to the server.
This method should be called at the end of each client-side game tick.

#### Returns

`void`

___

### join

▸ **join**(`world`): `Promise`<[`Network`](Network.md)\>

Join a world on the server.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `world` | `string` | The name of the world to join. |

#### Returns

`Promise`<[`Network`](Network.md)\>

A promise that resolves when the client has joined the world.

___

### leave

▸ **leave**(): `void`

Leave the current world. If the client is not in a world, this method does nothing.

#### Returns

`void`

A promise that resolves when the client has left the world.

___

### register

▸ **register**(...`intercepts`): [`Network`](Network.md)

Register a network intercept to the network. This is used so that one can define
the reaction to the network packets received. For instance, one can define a network
intercept to handle the `EVENT` type messages and perform something based on the

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `...intercepts` | [`NetIntercept`](../interfaces/NetIntercept.md)[] | One or more intercepts to add to the network. |

#### Returns

[`Network`](Network.md)

The network instance itself for chaining.

___

### send

▸ **send**(`event`): `void`

Send a raw network packet to the server. Must be a valid network packet, or else
the server may crash. For more details on network protocol messaging, see [here](/tutorials/basics/protocol-networking).

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `event` | `any` | The event packet to send to the server. |

#### Returns

`void`

___

### setID

▸ **setID**(`id`): `void`

Set the client's ID. This **needs** to be called before the network has connected to the server,
otherwise the client will be assigned a server-generated ID.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `id` | `string` | The ID of the client that is used to identify the client on server connection. |

#### Returns

`void`

___

### setUsername

▸ **setUsername**(`username`): `void`

Set the client's username. This **needs** to be called before the network has connected to the server,
otherwise the client will be assigned a `Guest XXXXX` username.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `username` | `string` | The username of the client that is used to identify the client on server connection. |

#### Returns

`void`

___

### unregister

▸ **unregister**(...`intercepts`): [`Network`](Network.md)

Unregister a network intercept from the network.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `...intercepts` | [`NetIntercept`](../interfaces/NetIntercept.md)[] | One or more intercepts to remove from the network. |

#### Returns

[`Network`](Network.md)

The network instance itself for chaining.

## Properties

### clientInfo

• **clientInfo**: `Object`

Information about the client that is sent to the server on connection. Initialize the username
through `setUsername` and the id through `setID`. If nothing is set, then the information will
be generated by the server and sent back to this client.

This is also the information passed into `NetIntercept` callbacks.

#### Type declaration

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `id` | `string` | The unique ID of the client. This can be set by `setID` **BEFORE** connecting to the server. If this is set before connection, then the ID will be used and the server will not generate a new ID for this client. |
| `username` | `string` | The username of the client. This can be set by `setUsername` **BEFORE** connecting to the server. Setting this username after connecting to the server will not change anything. |
